### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(tidymodels)
library(openintro)

data(ncbirths)

nrow(ncbirths)
# we got 1000 cases in the dataset. 

```

### Exercise-Baby weights
```{r code for baby weights chunk}
# H0:μ = 7.43 pounds
# H1:μ /= 7.43 pounds

ncbirths_white <- ncbirths %>% filter(whitemom == "white")
mean(ncbirths_white$weight, na.rm = TRUE)

# Are the criteria necessary for conducting simulation-based inference satisfied? Explain your reasoning.
# it's a shame for not entirely sure about the simulation-based inference.. but I looked up, and yes, I think it's satisfied. 
# it's a random sample, the sample size is ok, and each case is independent to others. nice :)

set.seed(123)
null_dist <- ncbirths_white %>%
  specify(response = weight) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "point", mu = 7.43) %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")

obs_mean <- ncbirths_white %>%
  specify(response = weight) %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")

visualize(null_dist) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_mean$stat, direction = "two-sided")

get_p_value(null_dist, obs_stat = obs_mean$stat, direction = "two-sided")


```

### Exercise 2
